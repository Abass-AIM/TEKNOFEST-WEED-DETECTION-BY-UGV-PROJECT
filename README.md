# TEKNOFEST WEED DETECTION BY UGV PROJECT
 This is an ongoing project developed for the TEKNOFEST Robotics Competition under the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) category. Our team is currently working on designing and programming a smart autonomous ground vehicle capable of navigating complex terrains, avoiding obstacles, detecting and identifying targets, and executing tasks with high precision.  The system integrates AI-based computer vision, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation algorithms to enable real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. We're actively developing both the hardware platform and the control software, aiming for a robust, modular, and scalable design.  Stay tuned as we continue building and testing our UGV for the TEKNOFEST challenge!
